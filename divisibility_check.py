for x in range(2,51):
    if x % 3 == 0:
        print("x is divisible by 3.")
    else:
        print("x is not divisible by 3.")



#In the same repo as before, switch to 'divisibility_check.py' and write a short Python divisibility checker program.  
#Your program will take the numbers from 2 through 50 (inclusive).  
#It will check to see if the number is divisible by 3 (hint: % operator).  If the number is divisible by three, 
# #print a message that says, "x is divisible by three" where x is the number being tested.  
#If it is not divisible by 3 print a message to that effect as well.

#Submit your work (both programs) by committing and pushing to GitHub. (There is no test code to run for this assignment.)
